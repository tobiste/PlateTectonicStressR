# PlateTectonicStressR

**PlateTectonicStressR** is a free and open-source **R** package for modeling and analyzing the direction of the maximum horizontal stress direction using relative plate motion.
Based on Wdowinski (1998).

## Prerequisites

You must have R installed on your system (see http://r-project.org). Additionally, to install rotationR from Github, you also need the devtools package. This can be installed by typing the following code at the R command line prompt:

```
install.packages("remotes")
```

## Installation

The most recent development version  of PlateTectonicStressR is available from Github and can be installed on your system as follows:

```
remotes::install_github('tobiste/PlateTectonicStressR')
library('PlateTectonicStressR')
```
