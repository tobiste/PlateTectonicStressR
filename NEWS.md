# tectonicr 0.2

* Calculation of rotation replaced by quaternions to boost performance
* "sp" class output for small circles, great circles and loxodromes deprecated
* new functions added to calculate mean/median stress direction, e.g. weighted mean

# tectonicr 0.1

* new functions to rotate stress directions and data points into PoR coordinate
system
* calculate distance of data point from plate boundaries
* Added functions to calculate relative plate motions from a set of absolute 
plate motions or different relative plate motions

# PlateTectonicStressR 0.0.1

* New `euler_loxodrome()` function to construct loxodromes directing towards an given point or Euler pole.

# PlateTectonicStressR 0.0.0.9000

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
