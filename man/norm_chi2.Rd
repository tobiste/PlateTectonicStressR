\title{Normalized chi-square test}
\usage{
norm_chi2(obs, prd, unc)
}
\arguments{
\item{obs}{observed SHmax, numeric vector}

\item{prd}{predicted SHmax, numeric vector of length of obs}

\item{unc}{uncertainty of observed SHmax, either numeric vector of length of
obs or a number}
}
\value{
numeric vector, numbers between 0 and 1 indicating the quality of the
predicted SHmax directions. Low values (<= 0.15) indicate good agreement,
high values (>0.7) indicate a systematic misfit between predicted and
observed SHmax directions
}
\description{
A quantitative comparison between the predicted and observed directions of
SHmax is obtained by the calculation of the average azimuth and by a
normalized chi-square test.
